// The Light Intensity System (LIS) is the detection method for the Solar Panel System to 
// determine where the highest intensity of light is. The LIS is constantly updating the 
// processing GUI via serial communication. This gives a live stream of data. The LIS 
// communicates with the GUI by sending instructions. Each instruction has an instructionID 
// followed by data members. The instructionID and each data member is seperated by a single
// white space " ". Since the LIS's only purpose is to send live data, it will not have any 
// incoming instructions nor will it have an instruction interpreter. 
//
// Note: The front of the LIS is indicated by an F written on the breadboard.
