# Optimized-Solar-Panel-System

The Optimized Solar Panel System uses a motorized base and photosensitive modules to follow the highest light intensity. Two servos make up the Positon System which controls the orientation of the system. One servo rotates the base, and the other to adjusts the angle of the solar panel. Five photosensitive modules are used for the Light Intensity System. There is one central photosensitive module that is pointed vertically upward facing the region the solar panel is facing. The central module will constantly move the entire system so that it is pointing at the highest light intensity. The other four modules are pointed diagonally up into four regions surrounding the central module. Once one of the four modules reads a new highest light intensity, the system will move so that the central module reads a highest intensity.

The Optimized Solar Panel System can be interfaced with the Driver which displays relevant information about each system. The Driver gives the user the ability to set each system's port and the pin of each sensor the systems are using. There are two modes the user can select from. Manual mode allows the user to enter each servo's angle measure. Auto mode uses the Adjustment System (contained in the driver) to calculate how to reposition the entire system based upon current sensor readings from the Position system.
